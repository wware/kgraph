class Evidence(BaseEntity):
    """
    Evidence for a relationship, treated as a first-class entity.

    Evidence entities have immediate canonical ID promotion using format:
    {paper_id}:{section}:{paragraph}:{method}

    Example canonical ID: "PMC8437152:results:5:llm"

    This format enables:
    - Immediate promotion (no provisional state needed)
    - Efficient lookups by paper/section
    - Deduplication across extraction runs
    - Database indexing for queries like "all evidence from Section 2"

    Attributes:
        entity_id: Canonical ID in format {paper_id}:{section}:{paragraph}:{method}
        paper_id: PMC ID of source paper
        text_span_id: Reference to TextSpan entity (for exact location)
        confidence: Confidence score 0.0-1.0
        extraction_method: Method used (scispacy_ner, llm, table_parser, pattern_match, manual)
        study_type: Type of study (observational, rct, meta_analysis, case_report, review)
        sample_size: Number of subjects in the study
        eco_type: ECO evidence type ID (e.g., "ECO:0007673" for RCT)
        obi_study_design: OBI study design ID (e.g., "OBI:0000008" for RCT)
        stato_methods: List of STATO statistical method IDs used

    Schema Rules:
    - entity_id MUST follow canonical ID format
    - paper_id and text_span_id MUST be non-empty
    - Evidence entities are immediately promotable (no usage threshold)
