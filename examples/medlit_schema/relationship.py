def create_relationship(predicate: str, subject_id: str, object_id: str, **kwargs) -> BaseRelationship:
    """
    Factory function for creating typed relationship instances.

    Provides type-safe relationship creation with predicate validation.
    Returns the appropriate relationship subclass based on predicate.

    Args:
        predicate: Relationship type (must match RELATIONSHIP_TYPE_MAP keys)
        subject_id: Entity ID of the subject
        object_id: Entity ID of the object
        **kwargs: Relationship-specific fields (evidence_ids, confidence, etc.)

    Returns:
        Typed relationship instance (Treats, Causes, Cites, etc.)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If predicate is not recognized

    Example:
        >>> rel = create_relationship(
        ...     predicate="TREATS",
        ...     subject_id="RxNorm:1187832",
        ...     object_id="C0006142",
        ...     evidence_ids=["PMC123:results:5:rct"],
        ...     response_rate=0.59,
        ...     confidence=0.85
        ... )
        >>> isinstance(rel, Treats)
        True
    """
    if predicate not in RELATIONSHIP_TYPE_MAP:

    relationship_class = RELATIONSHIP_TYPE_MAP[predicate]
