Discussion</title><p>Reversible hypoesthesia with TPI therapy was found in 58.7% of patients with MTrP. Our findings indicate the relatively high prevalence of reversible hypoesthesia in patients with MTrP. We also observed that a reduction in the size or disappearance of such hypoesthesia occurred in parallel with a reduction of myofascial pain. The reduction in the size of the hypoesthesia was observed progressively during TPI therapy and occasionally immediately after TPI. These findings suggest a close pathophysiological relation between MTrP and tactile sensation. In painful conditions other than muscular pain, the phenomenon of pain-induced tactile hypoesthesia has been described previously.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> As for underlying mechanisms, several brain imaging studies have shown that the activity of the primary somatosensory cortex decreases along with a decline in touch sensation.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Such inhibition of neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex induced by ongoing afferent nociceptive input from MTrP may underlie the reversible tactile hypoesthesia in patients with MPS.</p><p>Tactile hypoesthesia associated with myofascial pain can mimic that of neuropathic pain.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In our patients, a disappearance or reduction in the size of tactile hypoesthesia after TPI occurred less frequently in patients with secondary myofascial pain compared to those with primary myofascial pain. A lower frequency of reduction or disappearance of tactile hypoesthesia in patients with secondary MPS may be attributed to the existence of tactile hypoesthesia induced by nerve lesions in this group of patients. Topographically, remaining hypoesthetic areas observed after TPI therapy are thought of as hypoesthesia related to somatosensory nerve lesions that may be associated with neuropathic pain.</p><p>From a clinical point of view, we suggest that it is important to diagnose MTrP and treat it with TPI to distinguish neuropathic pain from myofascial pain. In addition, the mapping of hypoesthetic areas is useful for detecting MTrP because MTrP are located in the muscles in the vicinity of dermatomes to which the hypoesthetic areas belong.</p><p>This study had some limitations. One limitation is that we did not investigate the relationship between the area of reversible hypoesthesia and referred pain area. Numbness or hypoesthesia were reported to occur in the area of referred pain in patients with muscular pain<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> as well as volunteers with experimentally induced muscular pain.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Another limitation is that we were not able to investigate why some patients had tactile hypoesthesia and others did not, whereas 90% of patients in both groups experienced more than 50% pain relief by TPI.</p><p>In summary, although not always, reversible tactile hypoesthesia with TPI therapy often occurred in patients with MPS. Our present findings suggest that treating MTrP with TPI is important to distinguish tactile hypoesthesia associated with neuropathic pain from that with myofascial pain. Moreover, the mapping of tactile hypoesthesia on the skin seems useful for detecting MTrP because of their close topographical relation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Disclosures</title><p>The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the patients for permitting use of their photographs on this manuscript.
