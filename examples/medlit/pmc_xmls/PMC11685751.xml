Here, we describe an unusual case of pheochromocytoma-induced PCS. A 66-year-old woman was referred to the hospital due to pronounced weakness, loss of appetite, apathy, weight loss, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, and poorly controlled hypertension. The biochemical evaluation suggested ACTH-dependent hypercortisolemia with severe hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hyperglycemia. Markedly elevated levels of metanephrines, along with imaging showing a heterogeneous adrenal lesion, provided evidence for pheochromocytoma. Considering the clinical features and the results of laboratory and imaging tests, there was a suspicion of hypercortisolemia due to ectopic ACTH secretion by a pheochromocytoma. The patient underwent adrenalectomy following pre-treatment with doxazosin and metyrapone, enteral feeding, protein supplementation, and insulin administration. Post-surgery, the patient did not require further antidiabetic medication, experienced gradual weight gain, improved well-being, and did not need glucocorticoid supplementation. Histopathological examination confirmed a pheochromocytoma; however, both anti-ACTH and anti-CRH stainings were negative, leading to a diagnosis of PCS. This case highlights the distinctive presentation of PCS caused by pheochromocytoma, as demonstrated through clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings, and emphasizes the successful resolution achieved through adrenalectomy and supportive care.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome</kwd><kwd>ectopic ACTH secretion</kwd><kwd>hypercortisolaemia</kwd><kwd>pheochromocytoma</kwd><kwd>cachexia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="33"/><page-count count="7"/><word-count count="2489"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>section-in-acceptance</meta-name><meta-value>Neuroendocrine Science</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome (PCS), also referred to as non-neoplastic hypercortisolism, results from the physiological overactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). PCS can be triggered by conditions such as depression, eating disorders, severe physical stress, obesity, insulin resistance, chronic kidney disease, and chronic alcoholism (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Although the clinical manifestations of PCS may vary between patients, it is generally accepted that their onset is rather slow (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Importantly, the differentiation between PCS and CS is a diagnostic challenge even for experts in the field (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms contributing to overactivation of the HPA axis have been elegantly reviewed by Scaroni et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Briefly, lower levels of cortisol-deactivating enzymes 5-α-reductase and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 have been reported in patients with neurophychiatric disorders, reduced cortisol clearance, accompanied by changes in the affinity of cortisol to corticosteroid-binding globulin, elevation of corticotropic hormone (CRH) levels with resistance to glucocorticoids in patients with eating disorders, and increased secretion of CRH and increased activity of 11-βHSD type 1 in obese and alcohol-dependent individuals. PCS related to severe malnutrition has been rarely reported (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Distinguishing PCS from Cushing syndrome (CS), including ectopic ACTH secretion (EAS), can be difficult due to their similar clinical and biochemical presentations (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Hence, appropriate diagnosis is crucial to implement relevant treatment. Accurate decisions reduce the mortality risk associated with hypercortisolemia and preserve patient from the risk and complications associated with unnecessary procedures.</p><p>EAS is a paraneoplastic syndrome responsible for 10-20% of all cases of CS. CRH secretion by the tumor as well as CRH and ACTH co-secretion have been reported incidentally (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It is estimated that 70% of EAS cases arise from chest tumors, with small-cell carcinomas and bronchial carcinoids being the most frequent. The other 10% to 15% are attributed to neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas, while other rare sources include medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and others (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The molecular mechanisms leading to EAS, as well as other small molecule compounds in paraneoplastic symptoms, are not fully understood (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). To date, epigenetic mechanisms, especially POMC promoter hypomethylation, have been reported in some EAS-inducing tumors (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Additionally, tumor-specific expression of transcription factors favoring ACTH production has been suggested (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>The clinical picture of EAS is heterogeneous and depends of the original cause (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In general, two phenotypes of EAS can be observed: one associated with overt, mostly incurable malignancies, exemplified by small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and the other associated with occult neoplasm, represented by bronchial carcinoma. While the first group is characterized with an atypical presentation dominated by muscle wasting, malignancy-induced weight loss and electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, hyperpigmentation and rapid onset of symptoms (3-6 months), the second group exhibits characteristics of overt CS, a more slow (&gt;6 months) development of symptomatic disease that needs to be differentiated with Cushing disease (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Pheochromocytomas account for approximately 5% of EAS cases (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Extremely rare CRH-secreting pheochromocytomas leading to ectopic CS have also been reported (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). A meta-analysis by Elliot et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) revealed that the vast majority (89%) of patients with ACTH-secreting or CRH-secreting pheochromocytomas presented with the characteristic cushingoid phenotype with moderate or severe hypercortisolism. Hypokalemia in these patients was more common than in patients with pituitary-dependent CS, and the degree of hypertension was more severe than in the general population of patients with pheochromocytoma as well as in patients with EAS due to other types of tumors. The frequency of diabetes (54%) almost doubled the rate reported in the general population of pheochromocytoma patients (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Interestingly, Terzolo et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) reported a case of cyclic CS in a woman with ACTH-secreting pheochromocytoma, suggesting a complexity of possible manifestations in EAS.</p><p>While ACTH-dependent hypercortisolemia in patients with pheochromocytoma is very likely caused by EAS or a coexistence of corticotroph adenoma, the possibility of PCS also has to be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis. Herein, we present a unique case of pheochromocytoma-induced PCS evidenced by clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings, and underscore the successful resolution through adrenalectomy and supportive care.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Case report</title><p>A 66-year-old woman was admitted to the county hospital due to pronounced weakness, loss of appetite, apathy, and a weight loss of 5 kg within one month, along with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The patient had a history of spells; she reported high blood pressure accompanied by heart palpitations and headaches. Due to rapid weight loss, and a suspicion of malignancy, chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed. The CT revealed a heterogeneous, well-demarcated litho-cystic lesion (32x25 mm) in the right adrenal gland with inhomogeneous contrast enhancement (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">

Factors contributing to such intense manifestations of pheochromocytoma are yet to be identified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, no reports on PCS induced by pheochromocytoma have been published before. The presented case underscores the unique manifestation of these two coexisting conditions, evident through clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings. It also highlights the successful resolution through adrenalectomy and supportive care.</p><p>On admission to the endocrine department, our patient presented with cachexia and no typical symptoms of CS despite significant hypercortisolemia. The reason for such a clinical picture was the chronic overproduction of catecholamines leading to a hypermetabolic state through multiple mechanisms. Hypermetabolism might be mediated directly by adrenoceptors in metabolically active organs and tissues, resulting in stimulation of lipolysis and glycogenolysis, and indirectly, through induction of inflammation, which is reflected by increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In fact, increased resting energy expenditure (REE) measured by indirect calorimetry, accompanied by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, has been reported in a cohort of pheochromocytoma patients. Surgical treatment led to a decrease of REE to the expected calculated levels and normalization of some of the inflammation markers (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Moreover, catecholamines have been shown to activate brown adipose tissue, which was associated with decreased survival (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Interestingly, a hypermetabolic phenotype of pheochromocytoma is more often reported in the elderly (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and it can lead to cachexia (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), as in the described patient. In this case, we hypothesize that abundant and chronic secretion of catecholamines from the tumor led to a hypermetabolic and pro-inflammatory state that, in turn, overactivated the HPA axis (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure 4</bold>
</xref>). A rapid decrease in the level of cortisol, ACTH, and metanephrines upon initiation of metyrapone treatment suggests the existence of a glucocorticoid-dependent positive feedback loop that potentiated ACTH release and created a destructive cycle with rapid exacerbation of both hypercortisolemia and hypercatecholaminemia, with extremely elevated plasma ACTH levels. Metyrapone appeared to be clinically effective and resulted in lower levels of cortisol and catecholamines along with significantly lower levels of ACTH.</p><fig position="float" id="f4" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Postulated mechanism of pseudo-Cushing syndrome in our patient. Abundant and chronic secretion of catecholamines leads to hypermetabolic and proinflammatory state that in turn activates HPA axis. Cortisol may potentiate the secretion of catecholamines by increasing the expression of thyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme in the catecholamine synthesis pathway; and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, a key enzyme in noradrenaline-to-adrenaline conversion. A glucocorticoid-dependent positive-feedback loop may potentiate ACTH release.

It has been proposed that some diagnostic tests may facilitate distinguishing these two diagnoses (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>); however, the diagnostic options are limited with no access to CRH. In the case presented here, no dynamic tests were performed due to the severity of the patient’s condition. Some authors suggest that midnight cortisol serum levels above 7.5 μg/dL discriminate CS from PCS with 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity, as in PCS, an unaltered diurnal cortisol rhythm can be observed (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The disruption of the circadian rhythm of cortisol (and ACTH) is a distinguishing characteristic of CS, however, in our patient, the levels of midnight cortisol were highly elevated despite a lack of ACTH-positive cells in IHC and no other signs of CS. We did not find another case of pseudo-Cushing’s in the literature in which midnight cortisol levels were as high or higher. Disruptions in this rhythm are linked to a wide variety of psychological and physical conditions, such as depression (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), cognitive impairments (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), chronic stress (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), burnout (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), chronic fatigue syndrome (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and anorexia nervosa (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Upon admission, our patient was in a severe mental state due to discomfort, anxiety, and stress related to hospitalization. It is plausible that psychological factors, combined with cachexia, contributed to the disturbances in nocturnal cortisol secretion. There are no algorithms concerning the treatment of PCS, as cortisol levels are usually normalized following the resolution of the underlying cause. So far, only a few reports address the role of steroidogenesis inhibitors in lowering cortisol and contributing to recovery (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Our case demonstrates the successful resolution of hypercortisolemia before surgery by the administration of metyrapone. The importance of therapy with steroidogenesis inhibitors lies in their ability to prevent metabolic complications and eliminate glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The biochemical picture of PCS may present as ACTH dependent CS. Differentiation of PCS from other causes of hypercortisolemia poses a clinical challenge. Non-neoplastic hypercortisolemia occurs as a response to severe disorders and should always be considered in case of atypical course of hypercortisolemia. Metyrapone might be effective to block the glucocorticoid-dependent positive-feedback loop and minimalize the levels of cortisol, catecholamines, along with ACTH, thus it can reduce the perioperative risk.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.
