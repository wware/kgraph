Through a negative feedback system, the lack of cortisol synthesis causes an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) that determines hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex due to the continuous overstimulation and hypersecretion of precursors upstream of the enzyme defect.</p><fig position="float" id="bvaf018-F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The biochemistry of steroidogenesis. Typically, steroid hormones are classified into 5 groups: glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, estrogens, and progestogens. Adrenal gland is the major source of glucocorticoids (zona fasciculata) and mineralocorticoids (zona reticularis). Cortisol is the major representative of glucocorticoids, while aldosterone is the most prominent mineralocorticoid. The sex hormones—androgens (eg, testosterone and androstenedione), estrogens (eg, estradiol and estrone), and progestogens (such as progesterone)—are mainly synthesized by the gonads and placenta. The bottom of the Figure shows the biosynthetic pathways for major representatives of these classes of steroid hormones. The process of steroidogenesis initiates with the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone by cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme cytochrome P450scc (CYP11A1) within the mitochondria. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) facilitates the transport of cholesterol within the mitochondria. Pregnenolone is then catalyzed into other steroids by a series of oxidative enzymes located in both mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) hydroxylates pregnenolone and converts it to 17α-hydroxypregnenolone. Hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta (HSD3B2) oxidizes pregnenolone and forms progesterone, which is further hydroxylated by 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) and forms 11-deoxycorticosterone. All mineralocorticoids are synthesized from deoxycorticosterone. 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is produced from progesterone or from 17α-hydroxypregnenolone. 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) converts 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol from where glucocorticoids (eg, cortisol) are synthesized. 17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) acts on both 17α-hydroxypregnenolone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and forms dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, respectively, which act as precursors for testosterone and estrogen biosynthesis.

However, the development of adrenal crises depends on the accumulation of steroid precursors with glucocorticoid activity.</p><p>The predominant enzyme deficiency that accounts for 95% to 99% of all CAH cases is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) [<xref rid="bvaf018-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The 21OH enzyme converts 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone to deoxycorticosterone. These steroid precursors are then converted to cortisol and aldosterone (via corticosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone). Several studies on adrenal cortex function have established that the zona glomerulosa is responsible for the production of aldosterone, while the zona fasciculata is responsible for the production of cortisol [<xref rid="bvaf018-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 21OHD, all steroid precursors above the block are shunted to adrenal androgens and since the cortisol is low the ACTH secretion from the pituitary gland will increase further shunting steroid precursors to the androgen pathway and the adrenals will be hyperplastic (<xref rid="bvaf018-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>21OHD comprises 2 groups, the classic and nonclassic (NC) form. Classic 21OHD is further divided into salt-wasting (SW) (cortisol and aldosterone deficiency) and simple virilizing (SV) phenotype (cortisol and milder aldosterone deficiency) [<xref rid="bvaf018-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The first studies on 21OH activity indicated that the zona fasciculata of both the SW and the SV forms is defective in 21-hydroxylation of 17-hydroxy- and 17-deoxysteroids. The zona glomerulosa demonstrated deficient 21-hydroxylation only in the SW form, whereas in the SV form, the glomerulosa was spared this defect [<xref rid="bvaf018-B6" ref-type="bibr">6-8</xref>].</p><p>46,XX children with classic CAH have external virilized genitals while both 46,XX and 46,XY children with SW CAH will succumb to adrenal crisis if not diagnosed during the neonatal period. In contrast, 46,XX children with unnoticed virilization, and 46,XY children with SV CAH, may be undiagnosed until later in childhood or even occasionally in adulthood [<xref rid="bvaf018-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To prevent fatal SW crisis and late diagnosis in classic CAH, newborn screening (NBS) for 21OHD has been introduced in almost all high-income countries and also in many other countries [<xref rid="bvaf018-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B10" ref-type="bibr">10-13</xref>]. The NC form is not the aim of NBS; however, approximately one-third of patients with the NC form are incidentally detected during these investigations [<xref rid="bvaf018-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Most patients with NC CAH are diagnosed because of symptoms and signs of androgen excess, in childhood to young adulthood [<xref rid="bvaf018-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Since adrenal androgen excess will not affect 46,XY adults, most of 46,XY individuals with NC CAH are never diagnosed and if they are, it is usually due to family screening. Among patients with NC CAH, approximately one-third exhibit a partial cortisol response in the ACTH stimulation test [<xref rid="bvaf018-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, these patients rarely experience adrenal crises.</p><p>The main therapies in CAH are glucocorticoids to replace the deficiency and normalize the adrenal androgens and mineralocorticoids, compulsory in SW CAH but often also used in SV CAH [<xref rid="bvaf018-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mineralocorticoids, in the form of fludrocortisone, are particularly important prior to (since they may induce ovulation) and during pregnancy in patients with SW CAH but may also be used in those with SV CAH [<xref rid="bvaf018-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Unfortunately, to achieve good control of the adrenal androgens, supraphysiological glucocorticoid therapy is usually required, with increased risk of long-term complications such as cardiometabolic diseases as well as osteoporosis and fractures [<xref rid="bvaf018-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, elevated ACTH concentrations and severe phenotype are associated with adrenal rest tumors, especially testicular adrenal rest tumors, which are common and may affect fertility in male individuals with CAH [<xref rid="bvaf018-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. New therapies to normalize the glucocorticoid doses are, however, on the horizon [<xref rid="bvaf018-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The serum 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) concentration is utilized as the principal marker for 21OHD, since CAH due to 21OHD is detected in NBS programs using 17OHP concentration measurements in dried blood spots [<xref rid="bvaf018-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Genetic testing for 21OHD enzyme defects is currently available in many countries. Molecular diagnosis is important to confirm NBS results [<xref rid="bvaf018-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], for differential diagnosis and for ensuring proper family counseling with carrier identification and risk planning.</p><p>Nevertheless, 21OHD represents one of the most complex—and at the same time intriguing—topics in human genetics and its molecular diagnosis involves ongoing challenges. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about the genetics of 21OHD, with an emphasis on recent data.</p><sec id="bvaf018-s1"><title>Genetic Background of 21OHD: Gene Locus Structure and Nature of <italic toggle="yes">CYP21A2</italic> Variants</title><p>RCCX copy number variation (CNV), in the class III region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is a complex, multiallelic and tandem CNV defined by the variation in the number of copies of a DNA segment covering 4 adjacent genes: the serine/threonine kinase 19 (<italic toggle="yes">STK19</italic>, also known as <italic toggle="yes">RP1</italic>), the complement 4 (<italic toggle="yes">C4</italic>), the steroid 21-hydroxylase (<italic toggle="yes">CYP21</italic>), and the tenascin-X (<italic toggle="yes">TNX</italic>) genes [<xref rid="bvaf018-B25" ref-type="bibr">25-27</xref>].

In all 14 families, the fetal CAH status was correctly determined by 5 weeks and 6 days of gestation [<xref rid="bvaf018-B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="bvaf018-s7"><title>Correlation Between Genotype and Long-Term Outcomes</title><p>There is some evidence that knowing the genotype of the patient with CAH can predict long-term outcomes. For example, there is a correlation between the severity of the <italic toggle="yes">CYP21A2</italic> genotype and non-heterosexuality in women with CAH as 50% of women with the Null genotype have been reported to have a non-heterosexual orientation. Similar correlations in adult women with CAH were seen between genotype and working in male-dominant occupation and between genotype and motor interest [<xref rid="bvaf018-B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. However, it should be noted that long-term postnatal serum androgen concentrations have not been evaluated in these type of studies [<xref rid="bvaf018-B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Furthermore, it was observed that the more severe genotype and phenotype in women with CAH the less were the chances of biological children [<xref rid="bvaf018-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Such a correlation between genotype severity and having biological children was not seen in males with CAH [<xref rid="bvaf018-B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. It is possible to discuss whether trauma related to atypical genitalia influences lower desire among women with CAH to establish stable relationships and/or to become mothers. However, it should be noted that among women with CAH who wish to become mothers, there were no significant differences between the SW and SV forms [<xref rid="bvaf018-B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Finally, the correlation between genotype and other long-term outcomes, such as mortality [<xref rid="bvaf018-B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], psychiatric diseases [<xref rid="bvaf018-B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], cardiometabolic complications [<xref rid="bvaf018-B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="bvaf018-B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], fractures [<xref rid="bvaf018-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], injuries and accidents [<xref rid="bvaf018-B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], were more unclear.</p></sec><sec id="bvaf018-s8"><title>Concluding Remarks and Future Directions</title><p>The genetics of CAH due to 21OHD are complex. However, a genetic test to determine the <italic toggle="yes">CYP21A2</italic> variants is central in confirming the 21OHD diagnosis, genetic counseling, to predict the phenotype and possibly other aspects of CAH such as long-term outcomes. The discovery of CAH-X demands more of the <italic toggle="yes">CYP21A2</italic> gene analysis but will benefit the patients—although more research is needed. Due to the complexity of the gene analysis, simpler and cheaper methods are necessary, especially in countries where resources are more limited [<xref rid="bvaf018-B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. NGS sequencing could be something for the future. The demand for prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic testing is increasing. This latest approach enables studying the embryo before the transference to the uterus and allows prevention of the need to treat an unaffected embryo. This represents a major step forward for a couple to avoid clinical termination of an affected pregnancy [<xref rid="bvaf018-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="bvaf018-B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. However, most patients with CAH have never had a <italic toggle="yes">CYP21A2</italic> gene analysis, not even in many high-income countries, and wider use should be a priority.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="bvaf018-s9"><title>Funding</title><p>Magnus Bergvalls Stiftelse, Stockholm Läns Landsting, and Karolinska Institutet.</p></sec><sec id="bvaf018-s10"><title>Disclosures</title><p>No conflict of interest declared.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="bvaf018-s11"><title>Data Availability</title><p>Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.</p></sec><ref-list id="ref1"><title>References</title><ref id="bvaf018-B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
