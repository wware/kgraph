Their impact on cognitive function, mental health, and physical well-being cannot be ignored.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> Long-term stress responses and sustained exposure to pressure not only elevate the risk of multiple diseases but also result in considerable socioeconomic burdens. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 300 million people worldwide suffer from depression, with stress and emotional disorders being critical contributing factors.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> This phenomenon may be associated with prolonged exposure to high concentrations of cortisol induced by chronic stress.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr3-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> Such long-term elevated cortisol exposure is thought to exert adverse effects on multiple systems, including the nervous system, leading to anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment. While the roles of anxiety and depression have been well established,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> the specific impact on cognitive function remains unclear.</p><p>Research suggests that abnormally elevated cortisol levels significantly affect brain structure and function. The hippocampus, a key target highly sensitive to cortisol and central to learning and memory, is particularly affected. High cortisol exerts its effects through glucocorticoid receptors and mineralocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus, mediating neurophysiological responses. Prolonged activation may lead to neuronal damage, reduced neuroplasticity, and cognitive impairment.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Additionally, brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and amygdala are also impacted, potentially causing attentional deficits, impaired executive function, and emotional regulation disturbances.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, abnormal diurnal cortisol rhythms are closely linked to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cerebrovascular lesions.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> These mechanisms may interact synergistically to exacerbate cognitive impairment. While animal studies provide substantial evidence for cortisol's effects on cognitive function, human studies face ethical constraints and experimental limitations. The lack of models for long-term stress and pressure in humans, coupled with challenges in conducting long-term follow-ups, highlights the need for suitable research subjects.</p><p>Cushing's disease is an endocrine disorder caused by excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by anterior pituitary adenomas, leading to abnormally elevated cortisol levels.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr10-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</sup> The unique pathological features of Cushing's disease offer a natural model for studying the effects of prolonged high cortisol exposure on human cognitive function. Patients with Cushing's disease often experience cognitive impairments, with clinical manifestations including memory decline, attention deficits, and impaired executive function.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="bibr12-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr13-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, the specific mechanisms and risk factors underlying these impairments remain unclear.</p><p>Against this backdrop, this study uses Cushing's disease patients as subjects to systematically evaluate the impact of prolonged high cortisol exposure on cognitive function and analyze associated risk factors. Additionally, we develop a nomogram prediction model aimed at improving the identification of high-risk patients, providing a reference for clinical interventions, and offering new perspectives and evidence for the cognitive management and research of cortisol-related disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-25424823251338161"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2A-25424823251338161"><title>Study subjects</title><p>This study is a single-center retrospective study that included 107 patients diagnosed with Cushing's disease at the First Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital between January 2017 and January 2024.

The findings revealed that individuals exposed to long-term high cortisol levels generally experienced cognitive decline, with the CORT AM/PM, COR-8am, BMI, and FPG identified as major risk factors for cognitive impairment. Additionally, the developed nomogram model demonstrated excellent predictive performance in both the training (AUC = 0.80) and validation (AUC = 0.91) cohorts, highlighting its strong discriminative ability and clinical utility. These findings provide a foundation for mechanistic research and clinical management of prolonged high cortisol exposure.</p><p>BMI, FPG, CORT AM/PM, and COR-8am, as risk factors, are closely related to cortisol levels and its effects on the nervous system. Increased BMI was identified as an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment, likely due to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress caused by metabolic disorders.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="bibr15-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr16-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Obesity and elevated cortisol levels may form a vicious cycle, further exacerbating damage to the nervous system. Studies have shown that reduced cerebral blood flow and neuronal damage in obese individuals are directly linked to cognitive impairment,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr17-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</sup> underscoring the importance of monitoring metabolic status in Cushing's disease patients. High blood glucose was another critical risk factor, potentially affecting cognitive function through various mechanisms: prolonged hyperglycemia can lead to cerebrovascular damage and impaired blood supply to the brain;<sup>
<xref rid="bibr18-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> it may also directly harm neurons through oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr19-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup> Moreover, chronic hyperglycemia alters insulin signaling pathways, disrupting glucose metabolism in the brain and further aggravating cognitive decline.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr20-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup> Additionally, the study showed that disrupted cortisol circadian rhythms (elevated CORT AM/PM) and increased morning cortisol peaks (COR-8am) were closely associated with cognitive impairment. Circadian rhythm disruption may accelerate hippocampal atrophy and prefrontal cortex dysfunction by affecting the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr21-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</sup> Excessive morning cortisol peaks may exacerbate neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr22-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</sup> a finding also supported by previous animal studies.</p><p>Cushing's disease serves as an effective model for studying high cortisol states induced by chronic stress, given the high similarity in pathophysiological mechanisms between the two. Cushing's disease results from tumor-induced HPA axis hyperactivation, causing sustained cortisol overproduction,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr23-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup> while chronic stress similarly activates the HPA axis, maintaining cortisol at persistently high levels. Although the etiology of Cushing's disease is endogenous and pathological, whereas high cortisol in chronic stress is environmentally induced, both share similar features such as metabolic disturbances (e.g., insulin resistance, central obesity), immunosuppression (e.g., increased infection susceptibility), osteoporosis, and psychological disorders (e.g., anxiety and depression).<sup>
<xref rid="bibr24-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</sup> Therefore, Cushing's disease provides an effective model for studying metabolic, immune, and neurological changes in high cortisol states, offering experimental evidence for understanding chronic stress-related disorders and developing intervention strategies.</p><p>The results of this study align with previous animal experiments. For instance, animal studies have shown that prolonged cortisol exposure leads to hippocampal atrophy and neuronal damage, impairing cognitive function.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr25-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup> This study provides supportive evidence in human samples. Furthermore, prior research has found that disrupted cortisol circadian rhythms are often associated with executive function decline in patients with depression,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr26-25424823251338161" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</sup> consistent with our findings that CORT AM/PM is significantly associated with cognitive impairment in Cushing's disease patients. Unlike earlier studies focusing primarily on cortisol's direct neurotoxic effects, this study integrated metabolic indicators (e.g., BMI, FPG) to comprehensively analyze the interaction between cortisol and metabolic disturbances, expanding the understanding of mechanisms underlying cortisol-induced cognitive impairment.</p><p>Moreover, unlike previous research that was predominantly based on animal models, this study systematically analyzed data from 107 Cushing's disease patients, further validating these mechanisms in humans. The construction of the nomogram model significantly enhanced predictive accuracy, providing a practical tool for clinical application.</p><p>Despite providing important evidence for the impact of prolonged high cortisol exposure on cognitive function, this study has limitations. First, as a single-center retrospective study with a limited sample size, the results may lack generalizability and require prospective validation. Although Cushing's disease serves as a model for high cortisol exposure, further validation in populations experiencing chronic stress or prolonged pressure is needed. Second, the lack of long-term follow-up data prevents evaluation of the effects of surgical treatment or other interventions on cognitive function. Third, this study did not consider the impact of sex hormones on cortisol levels and cognitive function. Sex hormones (such as estrogen and testosterone) may regulate cortisol and influence the central nervous system.</p><sec id="section4A-25424823251338161"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study, using patients with Cushing's disease as a model, explored the impact of prolonged high-concentration cortisol exposure on human cognitive function. The findings revealed that individuals with prolonged high cortisol exposure commonly experience cognitive decline, with CORT AM/PM, COR-8am, BMI, and FPG identified as major risk factors for cognitive impairment. The nomogram model developed based on these risk factors demonstrated excellent predictive performance and clinical applicability in both the training and validation cohorts, providing an effective tool for the early identification of high-risk patients. These results not only confirmed the significant impact of prolonged high cortisol exposure on the central nervous system but also highlighted the critical role of metabolic factors in this process, emphasizing the multifactorial mechanisms of cognitive impairment. These findings offer a scientific basis for managing the cognitive health of Cushing's disease patients and provide important insights for prevention and treatment strategies for other cortisol-related conditions, such as chronic stress and metabolic syndrome.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the patient for granting permission to publish this information.
