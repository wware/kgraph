"""Pipeline interface definitions for document processing and extraction.

This module defines the abstract interfaces for the two-pass ingestion pipeline:

- **Pass 1 (Entity Extraction)**: Parse documents, extract entity mentions,
  and resolve them to canonical or provisional entities.
- **Pass 2 (Relationship Extraction)**: Identify relationships/edges between
  the resolved entities within each document.

The pipeline components are designed to be pluggable, allowing different
implementations for different domains (medical literature, legal documents,
academic papers, etc.) or different underlying technologies (LLMs, NER models,
rule-based extractors).

Typical flow:
    1. DocumentParserInterface converts raw bytes to BaseDocument
    2. EntityExtractorInterface identifies EntityMention instances
    3. EntityResolverInterface maps mentions to BaseEntity instances
    4. RelationshipExtractorInterface finds relationships between entities

    structural elements like sections and paragraphs.

    This is the entry point for the ingestion pipeline. The parsed document
    provides the content that subsequent extractors process.

    Example implementations might use:

    resolved to canonical or provisional entities.

    Entity mentions capture:
        - The exact text span and its position in the document

        - Extraction confidence score
        - Surrounding context for disambiguation

    Implementations may use:
        - Named Entity Recognition (NER) models (spaCy, Hugging Face transformers)
        - Large Language Models with structured extraction prompts
        - Rule-based pattern matching for domain-specific entities

       entities with similar meaning but different surface forms.

       medical terms, DBPedia for general knowledge, etc.) to obtain
       canonical identifiers.
    4. **Provisional creation**: If no match is found, create a provisional
       entity that may later be promoted to canonical status based on
