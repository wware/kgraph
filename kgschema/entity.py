"""Entity system for the knowledge graph framework.

This module defines the core entity types for the knowledge graph:

- **BaseEntity**: Abstract base class for all domain entities (nodes in the graph)
- **EntityMention**: Raw entity extraction from a document (before resolution)
- **EntityStatus**: Enum distinguishing canonical vs provisional entities
- **PromotionConfig**: Configuration for promoting provisional → canonical

**Entity Lifecycle:**

1. **Extraction**: The entity extractor finds mentions in document text,
   producing `EntityMention` objects with text spans and confidence scores.

2. **Resolution**: The entity resolver maps mentions to `BaseEntity` instances,
   either matching existing entities or creating new provisional ones.

3. **Promotion**: Provisional entities that accumulate sufficient usage and
   confidence are promoted to canonical status with stable identifiers.

4. **Merging**: Duplicate canonical entities detected via embedding similarity
   can be merged to maintain a clean entity vocabulary.

Entities are immutable (frozen Pydantic models) to ensure consistency when
referenced by relationships and stored in multiple indices.

    Entities are frozen (immutable) Pydantic models. To modify an entity,
