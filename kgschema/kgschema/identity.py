"""Identity server interface for the knowledge graph framework.

The identity server is the authoritative component for entity identity across
the knowledge graph. It handles the full entity identity lifecycle:

- **resolve**: Map a mention string to a canonical or provisional entity ID,
  creating a new provisional entity if no match is found.
- **promote**: Elevate a provisional entity to canonical status when
  domain-defined thresholds are met.
- **find_synonyms**: Detect entities that refer to the same real-world concept
  (read-only; does not perform merges).
- **merge**: Collapse duplicate entities into a single survivor, redirecting
  all references from absorbed entities to the survivor.
- **on_entity_added**: Event hook called after each entity insert, triggering
  synonym detection and merge for newly added entities.

Implementations must be correct under concurrent access from multiple worker
processes and multiple server replicas. All mutating operations must be
idempotent so that workers can safely retry after transient failures.

See CONCURRENCY.md (Identity Server Specification section) for the full
design rationale, locking strategy, and merge × promotion status rules.

    """Abstract interface for entity identity management.

    Implementations are responsible for resolving mentions to entity IDs,
    promoting provisional entities, detecting synonyms, and merging
    duplicates — all with correct behaviour under concurrent access.

    The recommended implementation is Postgres-backed, using:
    - ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`` for idempotent creation
    - ``SELECT FOR UPDATE`` for atomic promotion
    - Postgres advisory locks (keyed on sorted entity ID pairs) for merge
    - pgvector cosine similarity for synonym detection
    - Redis for authority-lookup caching (shared across replicas)

    Domain-pluggable behaviour (authority lookup, synonym thresholds,
    survivor selection, promotion thresholds) is supplied by the domain
    schema and its ``PromotionPolicy``.

        """Resolve a mention string to an entity ID.

        Performs domain authority lookup (e.g. UMLS, DBPedia) and returns a
        canonical ID if one is found. Otherwise creates and returns a new
        provisional ID. The lookup result is cached (keyed on normalised
        mention + authority source version) so that transient API failures
        do not produce inconsistent IDs on retry.

        This operation must be idempotent: resolving the same mention twice
        returns the same ID.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mention:
            The surface form of the entity mention.
        context:
            Domain-defined context (e.g. document ID, domain name, entity
            type hint, extraction metadata) used by authority lookup and
            synonym detection.

        Returns
        -------

        The domain ``PromotionPolicy`` determines whether promotion is

        - **provisional**: checks policy; upgrades if thresholds are met.
        - **canonical**: no-op; returns the existing canonical ID.
          Promotion is a one-time transition.
        - **merged**: the entity has been absorbed. Logs a warning with the

        ----------

        Synonym criteria are domain-defined and may include:

        All references (relationships, mentions, bundle edges) pointing to

        Must be called inside the same transaction as the entity insert so
