"""Storage interface definitions for the knowledge graph framework.

This module defines abstract interfaces for persisting knowledge graph data:
entities, relationships, and documents. These interfaces decouple the core
framework from specific storage backends, enabling:

- **In-memory storage** for testing and development
- **Relational databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for ACID guarantees
- **Vector databases** (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) for embedding search
- **Graph databases** (Neo4j, ArangoDB) for relationship traversal

All interfaces are async-first to support non-blocking I/O with database
drivers like asyncpg, motor, or aioredis.

The storage layer supports key knowledge graph operations:
    - Entity lifecycle: create, read, update, delete, promote, merge
    - Relationship management: add, query by subject/object, update references
    - Document tracking: store source documents for provenance
    - Similarity search: find entities by embedding vectors

      (UMLS CUIs, DBPedia URIs, etc.)
    - **Provisional entities**: Newly discovered mentions awaiting promotion

    Implementations must handle:

        - Atomic promotion (provisional → canonical) and merge operations
